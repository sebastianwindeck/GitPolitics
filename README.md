## [Git][Politics]

Hey citizen, how are you today?

*What is on your mind? How do you think about society? What should happen in our future?*

And by the way â€“ what are the professional society thinkers, the politicians and policy makers, doing meanwhile you are here and you are thinking about their jobs. 

### What has happened to politics?

*Transperancy* was one of the pillars of good old politics of the ancient Greek. You went to the market in the polis and you could check out what was going on in the city. You could come back a week later and see what has happened andyou could easily participate. over the centuries the world of politics became bigger and cities become nations and local politics become global politics or at least national politics. Far more people are involved in the process and some laws or declaration take time to develop, because of the complicated and complex structures we created. 

### State of the Art

When you would come to see politics today on the digital market, the internet, and you would come back a week later, would you see a difference? Could you track the changes? Would you understand what has happened and why? 

I feel that I cannot stay up-to-date with all the changes and decisions and once in a while it's my priviledge to judge the politicans who acted the past years and decide what might happen in the future. 

### Can the media be objective? 

Can a statistic be objective? Can data or an algorithm be ojective? 

I have the feeling this is impossible? But we can give people the chance to model information fair and transparent and easily comprehensible for everyone.

# Welcome to [Git][Politics]

## [Intro]

Imagine politics were as transparent as GitHub changes, so you could trust in government.

[Git][Politics] is currently a German student project aiming to 

1. **visualize politician's work world wide**,
2. visualize politics (**political processes**),
3. **clarify policies**
4. and make the entire political system comprehensible 

available for everyone. 



On this roadmap the aim is to develop a powerful tool to track all the changes on a easy to use interface. 

Secondly, is it possible to create executable law? We recently develop this ideas and want to integrate this in the [Git][Politics] process. Share your opinion in the comments and issues.

Git is a version control system and familiar tool in the programming world. It is primarly used for source code management, but can help to store any source of files versionizable. Git can be used on a variety on different servers. Mostly known are [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com). But also other servers can be used or created on private servers.

For all of you, who are not familiar with GitHub. Here is a little introduction page about [features of Github](https://github.com/features). They are very generic and appliable for several domains not only coding, but also politics. 


The [git cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) or the official [git_cheat_sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/) are a useful tool to get an overview of general the functions of git. Later on, we will provide a political definition of those functions and a domain applied git version for politics. For sure this will include a cheat sheet for '''gitpol'''

## [Politics]

Politics is about the political process to procede in law making of legislational power. Therefore, ussually poltical topics are subdivided into themes. An adaptable, iterable process is common practice.

## [OtherStuff]

On GitHub there are also other repositories created around the recently developing topic [politics](https://github.com/topics/politics). Take a look and feel free to add other ideas. Share your opinion to create a more transparent way to do politics. 

## [Team]

We are a small team of open-minded political and informatics interested people. 
If you are interested how coding and formalization can change politics, you are welcome to join the community.


## Yet to be done

- creating a applied fork of git for gitpol
- creating an applied cheat sheet for gitpol

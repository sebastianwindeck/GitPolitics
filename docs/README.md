# Welcome to [Git][Politics]

[Git][Politics] is currently a German student project aiming to 

1. visualize politician's work world wide,
2. visualize politics (political processes),
3. clarify policies
4. and make the entire political system comprehensible 

available for everyone. 

**Image politcs were as transparent as GitHub changes**

On this roadmap the aim is to develop a powerful tool to track all the changes on a easy to use interface. 

## [Git] 

Git is a version control system and familiar tool in the programming world. It is primarly used for source code management, but can help to store any source of files versionizable. Git can be used on a variety on different servers. Mostly known are [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com). But also other servers can be used or created on private servers.

A powerful tool of Git is the braches where different users can change parts of a repository and combine them after changes. 

## [Politics]

Politics is about the political process to procede in law making of legislational power. Therefore, ussually poltical topics are subdivided into themes. An adaptable, iterable process is common practice. 



## Yet to be done


[editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sebastianwindeck/GitPolitics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sebastianwindeck/GitPolitics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
